## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass (Preprocessor) for CSS [https://sass-lang.com/]
- SCSS syntax
- SASS variables
- Advice Slip JSON - [https://api.adviceslip.com/]
- Javascript

### What I learned

In this challenge I used an **API** for the first time, I thought I would encounter more problems regarding the implementation, but everything went well almost immediately. The rest of the challenge was really simple to do, i.e. the card with the advice inside so I had no problems ;)

### Continued development

I will continue to create other challenges in which an **API** needs to be implemented in order to be more confident in managing it and the **incoming data**.
